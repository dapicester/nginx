As it was already pointed out - you don't want to compile nginx
with g++, as it's written in C, not C++, while gcc invoked as g++
will assume .c files are in C++.

What you want is to compile *your module* with C++ compiler. This
is easy (even keeping in mind that nginx's build doesn't
distinguish between source files and always calls ${CC}): gcc will
recognize your module is in C++ as long as it's named
appropriately named[1] (e.g. *.cpp as in case of test module).

The only thing you have to do is to include C++ standard library
during linking. This may be done e.g. with --with-ld-opt
configure argument.

E.g. the following will compile nginx with test cpp module:

./configure --with-ld-opt="-lstdc++" --with-cpp_test_module && make
