GNU C Library page warning about using threads and fork:

    Because threads are not inherited across fork, issues arise. 
    At the time of the call to fork, threads in the parent process 
    other than the one calling fork may have been executing critical 
    regions of code. As a result, the child process may get a copy 
    of objects that are not in a well-defined state. This potential 
    problem affects all components of the program.
